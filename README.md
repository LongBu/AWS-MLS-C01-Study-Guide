## Data Engineering 

### Create data repositories for machine learning

  * Determine storage mediums (e.g., DB, Data Lake, S3, EFS, EBS) 
### Identify and implement a data ingestion solution.

#### Data job styles/types (batch load, streaming)

#### Data ingestion pipelines (Batch-based ML workloads and streaming-based ML workloads)

##### Amazon Kinesis Data Streams:
  * On-demand capacity mode or Provisioned mode (if throughput exceeded exception => add shard[s])
  * Can have up to 5 parallel consumers
  * Synchronously replicate streaming data across 3 AZ in a single Region and store between 24 hours and 365 days in shard(s) to be consumed/processed/replayed by another service and stored elsewhere
  * Use fan-out if lag is encountered by stream consumers
  * Shards can be split or merged
  * 1 MB message size limit
  * TLS in flight or KMS at-rest encryption
  * *Can't subscribe to SNS*
  * *Can't write directly to S3*
  * Can output to:
    * Kinesis Data Firehose
    * Kinesis Data Analytics
    * Containers
    * λ
    * AWS Glue

##### Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics:
  * Fully Managed (serverless)
  * Can use either Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Data Firehose to analyze data in kinesis
  * For SQL Applications: Input/Output: Kinesis Data Streams or Kinesis Data Firehose to analyze data
  * For Apache Flink (on a cluster): 
    * Input: Kinesis Data Stream or Amazon MSK
    * Output: Sink (S3/Kinesis Data Firehose)    

##### Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose:
  * Fully Managed (serverless) service, no administration, automatic scaling
  * Can use λ to filter/transform data prior to output (Better to use if filter/tranform with a λ to S3 over Kinesis Data Streams)
  * Near real time: 60 seconds latency minimum for non-full batches
  * Minimum 1 MB of data at a time
  * Pay only for the data going through
  * Can subscribe to SNS
  * No data persistence and must bre immediately consumed/processed
  * Sent to (S3 as a backup or failed case[s]):
    * S3
    * Amazon Redshift (copy through S3)
    * Amazon Elastic Search
    * 3rd party partners (datadog/splunk/etc.)

    * Task Node (optional): only to run tasks-usually Spot Instances
  * Can have long-running cluster or transient (temporary) cluster
  * Purchasing options: 
    * On-demand: reliable, predictable, won't be terminated
    * Reserved: cost savings (EMR will use if available)
    * Spot instances: cheaper, can be terminated, less reliable

##### AWS Glue:
  * Managed ETL service (fully serverless) used to prepare/transform data for analysis
  * Can be event driven (eg: λ triggered by S3 put object) to call Glue ETL
  * Glue Data catalog uses an AWS Glue Data Crawler scanning DBs/S3/data to write associated metadata utilized by Glue ETL, or data discovery on Athena, Redshift Spectrum or EMR
  * Glue Job bookmarks prevent reprocessing old data
  * Glue Databrew-clean/normalize data using pre-built transformation
  * Glue Studio-new GUI to create, run, and monitor ETL jobs in Glue
  * Glue Streaming ETL (built on Apache Spark Structured Streaming)-compatible with Kinesis Data Streaming, Kafka, MSK
  * Glue Elastic Views:
    * Combine and replicate data across multiple data stores using SQL (View)
    * No custom code, Glue monitors for changes in the source data, serverless
    * Leverages a "virtual table" (materialized view)

  * You submit/schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch handles it
  * Provisions right amount of compute/memory
  * Batch jobs are defined as *docker images and run on ECS*
  * Helpful for cost optimization and focusing less on infrastructure
  * No time limit
  * Any run time packaged in docker image
  * Rely on EBS/instance store for disk space
  * Advantage over λ=>time limit, limited runtimes, limited disk space

## Exploratory Data Analysis



### Sanitize and prepare data for modeling
