## Data Engineering 

### Create data repositories for machine learning

#### Identify data sources (e.g., content and location, primary sources such as user data)(TBD)
#### Determine storage mediums (e.g., DB, Data Lake, S3, EFS, EBS)(TBD)
##### DB(TBD)
##### Data Lake
  * Offers centralized architecture within S3
  * Decouples storage (S3) from compute resources
  * Analagous to S3 buckets any format is permitted, but typically they are: CSV, JSON, Parquet, Orc, Avro, and Protobuf

##### S3

###### Buckets:
  * Service to allow objects/files within a virtual "directory"
  * Bucker names must be *globally unique*
  * Buckets exist within AWS regions
  * Not a file system, and if a file system is needed, EBS/EFS/FSx should be considered
  * Not mountable as is a NFS
  * Supports any file format
  * Name formalities:
    * Must not start with the prefix 'xn--'
    * Must not end with the the suffix '-s3alias'
    * Not an IP address
    * Must start with a lowercase letter or number
    * Between 3-63 characters long
    * No uppercase
    * No underscores

###### Objects/Files
   * Each has a key, it's full path within the s3 bucket including the object/file separated by backslashes ("/")
   * Each has a value, it's content
   * Note there is no such thing as a true directory within S3, but the convention effectively serves as a namespace
   * Compression is good for cost savings concerning persistence
   * Max size is 5 TB
   * If uploading > 100MB and absolutely for > 5 GB, use Multi-Part upload
   * S3 Transfer Acceleration also can be utilized to increase transfer rates (upload and download) by going through an AWS edge location that passes the object to the target S3 bucket (can work with Multi-Part upload)
   * Strong consistency model to reflect latest version/value upon write/delete to read actions
   * Version ID if versioning enabled at the bucket level
   * Metadata (list of key/val pairs)
   * Tags (Unicode key/val pair >= 10) handy for lifecycle/security
   * Endpoint offers HTTP (non encrypted) and HTTPS (encryption in flight via SSL/TLS)

###### Security (IAM principle can access if either of the policy types below allows it and there is no Deny present):
  * Types
    * User Based: governed by IAM policies (eg: which user,  within a given AWS account, via IAM should be allowed to access resources) 
    * Resource Based:
      * Bucket Policies (JSON based statements)
        * Governing such things as:
          * (Blocking) public access \[setting was created to prevent company data leaks, and can be set at the account level to ensure of inheritance]
          * Forced encryption at upload (necessitates encryption headers).  Can be alternatively be done by "default encryption" via S3, though Bucket Policies are evaluated first
          * Cross account access
        * Bucket policy statement attributes 
          * SID: statement id
          * Resources: per S3, either buckets or objects
          * Effect: Allow or Deny
          * Actions: The set of api action to apply the effect to
          * Principal: User/Account the policy applies to
      * Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer control of individual objects (eg: block public access)
      * Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - control at the bucket level (eg: block public access)
  * S3 Object(s) are owned by the AWS account that uploaded it, not the bucket owner
  * Settings to block public access to bucket(s)/object(s) can be set at the account level
  * S3 is accessible to other AWS resources via:
    * VPC endpoint (private connection)
      * bucket policy tied to AWS:SourceVpce (for one endpoint)
      * bucket policy tied to AWS:SourceVpc (for all possible endpoint(s))
    * Public internet via an IGW=>public ip tied to a bucket policy tied to AWS:SourceIP:
  * S3 Access Logs can be stored to another S3 bucket (not the same to prevent infinite looping)
  * Api calls can be sent to AWS CloudTrail
  * MFA Delete of object(s) within *only* versioned buckets to prevent accidental permanent deletions *[only enabled/disabled by bucket owner via CLI]*

  * Durability: How often a file is not to be lost
  * Availability: How readily S3 bucket/files are available

###### S3 Standard:
  * Used data frequently accessed
  * Provides high throughput and low latency
  * Good for mobile and gaming applications, pseudo cdn, big data/analytics

###### S3 Standard Infrequent Access
  * Good for data less frequently acessed that need immediate access
  * Cheaper than Standard
  * Good for Disaster Recovery and/or backups

###### S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  * Modest fee for monthly monitoring and auto-tiering
  * Moves objects between tiers based on usage
  * Access tiers include:
    * Frequent (automatic) default
    * Infrequent (automatic) not acessed for 30 days
    * Archive Instant (automatic) not accessed for 90 days
    * Archive (optional) configurable between 90 days to >= 700 days
    * Deep Archive (optional) configurable between 180 days to >= 700 days 

###### S3 One Zone-IA
  * Data lost when AZ is lost/destroyed
  * Good for recreateable data or on-prem data secondary backup copies

###### S3 Glacier
  * Never setup a transition to glacier classes if usage might need to be rapid
  * Good for archiving/backup
  * Glacier Instant Retrieval is a good option for accessing data once a quarter
  * Harness Glacier Vault Lock (WORM) to no longer allow future edits, which is great for compliance and data retention
  * Glacier or Deep Archive are good for infrequentyly accessed objects that don't need immediate access

###### S3 Lifecycle Transitions (can also be conducted manually via AWS Console)

###### S3 Lifecycle Rules
  * Transition Actions: rules for when to transtion objects between s3 classes (see S3 storage classed above)
  * Expiration Actions: rules for when to delete an object after some period of time
    * Good for deleting log files, deleting old versions of files (if versioning enabled), or incomplete multi-part uploads
  * Rules can be created for object prefixes (addresses) or associated object tags

###### S3 Data Partioning
  * Harnesses disparate key \[path] to speed up queries (eg: Athena)
  * Typical scenarios are:
    * time/date (eg: s3://bucket/datasetname/year/month/day/....)
    * product (eg: s3://bucket/datasetname/productid/...)
  * Partitioning handled by tools such as Kinesis, Glue, etc.

###### Encryption
  * SSE-S3:
    * Encryption (keys) managed by AWS (S3)
    * Encryption type of AES-256
    * Encrypted server side via HTTP/S and Header containing "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"
    * Enabled by default for new buckets and objects
  * SSE-KMS
    * Encryption (KMS Customer Master Key [CMK]) managed by AWS KMS
    * Encrypted server side via HTTP/S and Header containing "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"
    * Offers further user control and audit trail via cloudtrail
    * May be impacted by KMS limits, though you can increase them via Service Quotas Console
      * Upload calls the GenerateDataKey KMS API (counts towards KMS quota 5500, 10000, or 30000 req/s based upon region)
      * Download calls the Decrypt KMS API (also counts towards KMS quota)
  * SSE-C:
    * Server side encryption via *HTTPS only*, using a fully managed external customer key external to AWS that must be provided in the HTTP headers for every HTTP request (key isn't saved by AWS)
    * Objects encrypted with SSE-C are never replicated between S3 Buckets
  * Client Side Encryption:
    * Utilizes a client library such as Amazon S3 Encryption Client
    * Encrypted prior to sending to S3 and must be decrypted by clients when retrieving from S3 conducted over HTTP/S
    * Utilizes a fully managed external customer key external to AWS
    * S3 objects useing SSE-C not able to be replicated between buckets

###### Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS) vs none
  * HTTP Endpoint - non-encrypted
  * HTTPS Endpoint - encrypted
  * To force encryption, a bucket policy is in order, and the following is an HTTP Get version
    * { "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect":"Deny",
           "Principal":"\*",
           "Action":"s3:GetObject",
           "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::random-bucket-o-stuff/*",
           "Condition":{
             "Bool":"aws:SecureTransport":"false"
           }

         }
       ]
      }
  * To force SSE-KMS encryption
    * { "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect":"Deny",
           "Principal":"\*",
           "Action":"s3:PutObject",
           "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::random-bucket-o-stuff/*",
           "Condition":{
             "StringNotEquals":{"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws-kms"}
           }

         }
       ]
      }
  * To force SSE-C encryption
    * { "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect":"Deny",
           "Principal":"\*",
           "Action":"s3:PutObject",
           "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::random-bucket-o-stuff/*",
           "Condition":{
             "Null":{"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm":"true"}
           }

#### ML on AWS (application services)

##### Amazon Polly:
* Turn text into lifelike speech using deep learning (for talking applications)
* Customize pronunciation of words with pronunciation lexicons that are harnessed by the Sythesize Speech Operation
* Can map stylized words and/or acronyms to resultant output
* Generate more customized output from text marked up with SSML including:
  * breating, whispering
  * emphasis on words
  * phonetic pronunciation

##### Amazon Lex: 
  * ASR to convert speech to text
  * Natural language understanding to recognize parts of speech/text
  * Helps to build chatbots, call center bots

##### Amazon Comprehend (Medical):
  * Serverless NLP service harnessing ML to uncover valuable insights and connections in text
  * Medical version detects PHI via DetectPHI API

##### Amazon Transcribe:
  * Automatically convert speech to text
  * Uses Deep Learning - Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
  * Use cases:
    * Transcribe customer calls
    * Automate close capitioning/subtitles
    * Generate metadata for media assets to create full scaleable architecture
  * Can remove PII using redaction
  * Supports automatic language identification for multi-lingual audio
  
##### Amazon Rekognition:
  * Find objects, people, text, scenes in images and videos using ML
  * Facial analysis and search to perform user verification, people counting
  * Create a DB of "familiar faces" or compare against celebrities
  * Use cases: 
    * Labeling
    * Text detection
    * Face detection and analysis (gender, emotions, age range, etc.)
    * Face search and verification
    * Celebrity recognition
    * Pathing (eg: for sports game analysis)
    * Content Moderation (inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive images/videos)
      * Social media/broadcast media/advertising/e-commerce
      * Confidence level of content flags/gates (threshold configuration based)
      * Flag sensitive content for manual review in A2I
      * Help comply with regulations
		
 ##### Amazon Textract:
   * Extracts text, handwriting and data from any scanned documents (eg: forms, tables, etc.) using ML
   * Read from any type of document (PDFs, images, etc.)
   * Good for invoices, financial reports, medical records, insurance claims, taxforms, ids, passports
		
##### Amazon Translate:
  * Natural and accurate language translation
  * Allows localization of content (eg applications/websites) for international users, and to easily translate large volumes of text efficiently 

#### AWS service limits(TBD)
#### Build your own model vs. SageMaker built-in algorithms(TBD)
#### AWS SageMaker:
  * File Mode:
    * Useful for small files that fit in memory and where the algorithm has a large number of epochs
    * Can leverage the file system cache for secondary epochs, the overall I/O throughput with Pipe mode is still faster than file mode
  * Pipe Mode:
    * Recommended for large datasets
    * Overall I/O throughput with Pipe mode is still faster than file mode
    * Can stream dataset directly to your training instances where data is fed on-the-fly without using any disk I/O or downloading the complete file prior to execution. 
    * Shorter startup times because the data is being streamed instead of being downloaded to your training instances.
    * Higher I/O throughputs due to our high-performance streaming agent (no disk I/O usage).
    
#### Infrastructure: (spot, instance types), cost considerations(TBD)
##### Using spot instances to train deep learning models using AWS Batch (TBD)
### Apply basic AWS security practices to machine learning solutions(TBD)
#### IAM(TBD)
### S3 Bucket Policies vs Access permissions:
  * Used to add or deny permissions across some or all S3 objects in a bucket, enabling central management of permissions
  * Can grant users within an AWS account or other AWS accounts to S3 resources
  * Can restrict based on request time (Date condition), request sent using SSL (Boolean condition), requester IP Address (Ip address condition) using policy keys
  * User access to S3 => IAM permissions
  * Instance (EC2) access => IAM role
  * Public access to S3 => bucket policy

| Type of Access Control | Account Level Control | User Level Control |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| IAM Policies | No | Yes |
| ACLs | Yes | No |
| Bucket Policies | Yes | Yes |

#### Security groups(TBD)
#### VPC(TBD)
#### Encryption/anonymization(TBD)
### Deploy and operationalize machine learning solutions.
  * Exposing endpoints and interacting with them
  * ML model versioning
  * A/B testing
  * Retrain pipelines
  * ML debugging/troubleshooting
    * Detect and mitigate drop in performance
    * Monitor performance of the model
